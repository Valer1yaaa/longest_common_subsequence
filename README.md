# Finding the maximum common subsequence
The problem of finding the maximum common subsequence is a classic problem in computer science. Given two sequences, the goal is to find the longest subsequence that is common to both sequences. It is often solved using dynamic programming, where a table is constructed to store the lengths of the LCS for different prefixes of the sequences. The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution is **O(m*n)**, where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences.
